# Future Improvements - Information Needed

This document outlines advanced improvements that require additional expertise or research beyond what can be implemented immediately.

## High Priority Improvements Requiring Expertise

### 1. Pydantic Input Validation Models

**Current Issue**: Tools have very long function signatures and complex input validation/conversion logic that makes them hard to maintain.

**Proposed Solution**: Use Pydantic models for input validation, parsing, and default value management.

**Information Needed**:
- Detailed analysis of all current input parameters across all tools
- Design of Pydantic models that maintain backward compatibility
- Strategy for handling unit conversions within Pydantic validators
- Testing approach to ensure no regression in functionality

**Expertise Required**: Senior Python developer with Pydantic experience

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

**Example**:
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, validator

class PumpRequirementsInput(BaseModel):
    flow_rate_gpm: Optional[float] = None
    flow_rate_m3s: Optional[float] = None
    temperature_c: float = Field(default=20, ge=-50, le=200)
    
    @validator('*', pre=True)
    def convert_units(cls, v, field):
        # Unit conversion logic here
        return v
```

### 2. Enhanced Gas Mixture Properties

**Current Issue**: The tools use simplified assumptions for gas mixtures (Z-factor, gamma) which can lead to inaccuracy for complex gas compositions.

**Proposed Solution**: Implement proper mixing rules for thermodynamic properties or integrate with specialized gas mixture libraries.

**Information Needed**:
- Review of standard gas mixture mixing rules (Kay's rule, Lee-Kesler, etc.)
- Evaluation of available Python libraries for gas mixture properties
- Benchmark testing against known gas mixture data
- Integration strategy with existing CoolProp/fluidprop workflow

**Expertise Required**: Chemical engineer with thermodynamics expertise, particularly gas mixture behavior

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks

**Resources Needed**:
- Access to NIST gas mixture databases for validation
- Literature review of mixing rules for specific heat ratios and compressibility factors
- Testing with real-world biogas compositions

### 3. Improved Numerical Solvers for Open Channel Flow

**Current Issue**: Custom secant method solver in `open_channel_flow_new.py` may not be as robust as library functions across all edge cases.

**Proposed Solution**: Replace custom solvers with scipy.optimize functions while maintaining compatibility with symbolic math from pydraulics.

**Information Needed**:
- Analysis of numerical stability issues with current solver
- Benchmarking against scipy.optimize methods (brentq, fsolve, etc.)
- Testing across wide range of channel geometries and flow conditions
- Performance comparison with current implementation

**Expertise Required**: Numerical methods specialist or hydraulic engineer

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks

### 4. Expanded Fitting K-Factor Database

**Current Issue**: While `get_fitting_K` maps to many standard fittings, coverage could be improved for specialized applications.

**Proposed Solution**: Expand the fitting database with manufacturer data and more specialized fittings.

**Information Needed**:
- Compilation of K-factors from major valve/fitting manufacturers
- Standardization of fitting naming conventions
- Validation against published data
- Strategy for handling fitting variations (e.g., different entrance conditions)

**Expertise Required**: Mechanical engineer with piping systems expertise

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

**Resources Needed**:
- Access to manufacturer catalogs and technical data
- Standard references (Crane TP-410, ASHRAE Handbook, etc.)

## Medium Priority Improvements

**Information Needed**:
- Implementation of additional valve types (rotary, eccentric plug, etc.)
- Noise prediction calculations per IEC 60534-8-3
- Cavitation index calculations for liquid service
- Multi-stage pressure reduction calculations

**Expertise Required**: Control valve specialist

### 6. Heat Transfer Integration

**Information Needed**:
- Integration strategy with heat transfer calculations
- Temperature-dependent property handling in flow calculations
- Thermal expansion effects in piping systems

**Expertise Required**: Heat transfer engineer

### 7. Economic Optimization Features

**Information Needed**:
- Life cycle cost analysis for pump/blower selection
- Energy cost optimization algorithms
- Maintenance cost modeling

**Expertise Required**: Engineering economist
