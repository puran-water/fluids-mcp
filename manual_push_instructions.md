# Manual Push Instructions

Since authentication is required, please follow these steps manually:

## Option 1: Force Push (Recommended)

Open Command Prompt or Git Bash and run:

```bash
cd C:\Users\hvksh\mcp-servers\fluids-mcp
git push origin main --force
```

When prompted:
- Username: `hvkshetry`  
- Password: Use your GitHub Personal Access Token (not your account password)

## Option 2: If you don't have a Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "fluids-mcp-push"
4. Select scopes:
   - `repo` (all of it)
   - `workflow` (if you want GitHub Actions to work)
5. Generate token and copy it
6. Use this token as your password when pushing

## Option 3: Delete and Recreate Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/puran-water/fluids-mcp/settings
2. Scroll to bottom → "Delete this repository"
3. Confirm deletion
4. Create new repository:
   - Go to https://github.com/puran-water
   - New repository → name: `fluids-mcp`
   - **DO NOT** initialize with any files
5. Then push:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\hvksh\mcp-servers\fluids-mcp
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## What Will Be Pushed

Your complete fluids-mcp server with:
- ✅ All source code with bug fixes
